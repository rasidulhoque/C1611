"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand,good programmers write codes that human understood"

Well,hellow evryone being a BCA 1st sem student, I have go learn various C programs as it is on my course. Though, i haven't go though tipical programs yet but i will try to adapt this language as soon as possible and bring you up with some of the great programs.
Some of the most intersting parts in c what i have felt till date are:-
                                                                        .It has only 32 keyword which makes it extemly easier to learn
                                                                        .Structured language
                                                                        .And most inportantly,it arises new challenges for the programer which enable the user to think.
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                            HOPEFULLY,LEARN THIS LANGUAGE IN ITS EXTREAME LLEVEL!!!
