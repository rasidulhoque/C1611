"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand,good programmers write codes that human understood".

Hello evryone being a BCA 1st sem student, I have to learn various C programs as it is in my course. Though, i haven't gone though tipical programs yet but i will try to adapt this language as soon as possible and bring you up with some of the great programs.
Some of the most intersting parts in c what i have felt till date are:-
                                                                        
=>It has only 32 keyword which makes it extemly easier to learn
                                                                        =>Structured language
                                                                        =>And most inportantly,it arises new challenges for the programer which enable the user to think of the problem.
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                            HOPEFULLY,LEARN THIS LANGUAGE IN ITS EXTREAME LLEVEL!!!
